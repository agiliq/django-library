A simple app, to take care of books in an org. Probably a small digital library.

It will also do the following:

1. Which is amongst the favorite book. 
2. Which employee is the most voracious reader. 
3. You can make a book request for the library to the admin. 
4. More features as it grows.  
5. Its live on [library.agiliq.com](http://library.agiliq.com/)

TODO:
1. Add a user profile.
2. Write a script that auto populates the book details, in the database.
